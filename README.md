# Proiect-Python - Expenses report

For bussiness and people who want to keep track with the expenses

App that notifies on the screen if the expeses reached the amount fixed for a certain category of purchases
Used a library that notifies 

(Be aware if you want to use this library after a time the Windows will disable the notifications, considering it a spam, so if you want to demo the app with the library, see if it is working the notfication, if not check stackoverflow, this is what I did)
